![A Launchpad Mini](http://global.novationmusic.com/sites/default/files/styles/cta_scale_1280/public/2-LP-Mini_1%5B1%5D.png)
# launchpad

A Clojure library for interacting with a Novation Launchpad.

Tested with a new
[Launchpad Mini](http://global.novationmusic.com/launch/launchpad-mini) in
2015, which I understand works the same as a Launchpad S, but smaller. It may
work for an older model Launchpad too. The new full-size Launchpad and
Launchpad Pro with RGB colors could probably be made to work, if you're
interested reach out. 

## Usage

```clojure
(require '[launchpad.core :as lp])

;; Connect to and initialize the Launchpad
(def pad (lp/new-launchpad))

;; blinkenlights
(.grid pad [x y] [red green]) ; light a grid button
(.top pad x [red green])      ; light a top-row button
(.right pad y [red green])    ; light a right side-column button

;; start over
(.reset pad)
```

Colors are `[red green]` where `red` and `green` range from
0 (off) to 3 (brightest). Red and green mix to yield amber.

Coordinates are 0-indexed starting from the top-left.

## Gotchas
There is a Java bug on OSX: Java caches the MIDI device list indefinitely. So
you need to have the Launchpad plugged in before starting the program/repl.

## TODO
This initial release only allows you to send commands to the Launchpad.
Next up: allow you to respond to button presses by the user!
